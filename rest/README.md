# RESTful Thinking

A high octane, politically charged REST API with strong opinions.

* Thinks that REST is the best API
* Thinks that SOAP is the worst API
* Doesn't bother with anything other than a GET request
* Doesn't bother with API versions


## How to use it:
1. Draw some forward slashes.
2. Add some words.
3. Use the REST of the API.
